  I am a graduate of the University of Silesia in Cieszyn, specializing in organ performance at the Faculty of Arts ðŸŽ¹. Currently, I am embarking on my journey as a software tester. In pursuit of this goal, I actively explore various materials to expand my knowledge necessary in this field ðŸ’ª. My particular interests revolve around test automation, which is why I am learning programming languages and tools dedicated to test automation. Among my achievements is winning a competition for the best test plan organized by testerzy.pl ðŸ¥‡. I also hold the MITC Software Testing Level 01 certificate ðŸ’ª.
